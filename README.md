### Hi there 👋

My name is Felix, I'm a selft-though and mostly lone wolf programmer. I work mostly on C# CLI and integratable code.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning UWP UI and app developpment. I try to keep up to date on C# and python
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source project
- 💬 Ask me about C# python and microcontroller (arduino, atmega, rp2040) development
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

I'm looking into starting in open source collaboration, but I don't know where to start
